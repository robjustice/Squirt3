Port of the Apple II program selector/viewer to Apple /// SOS

This is the start of porting over the Apple II Prodos file selector Squirt to Apple /// SOS. I have the program loading volumes and navigating directories, using SOS calls and .CONSOLE for input/output.

The source code may be useful for someone working with SOS programs. I have attached a disk image with this loaded as the SOS.INTERP.  

Still needs alot to be done.
